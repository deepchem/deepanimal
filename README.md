Deep Learning for Animal Models of Disease

This repo is intended to enable the use of deep learning to create computational animal models for drug discovery. As of now, this repo is currently a stub. If you're interested in helping, please raise issues with ideas for how machine learning or computational techniques in general can help model animals.
